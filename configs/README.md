## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: Use a Preset Configuration
```bash
# Use a specific configuration
./setup-env.sh install --config configs/webdev.yaml

# Or copy the config to use as your main config
cp configs/minimal.yaml config.yaml
./setup-env.sh install
```

### Option 2: Create Your Own Configuration
1. Copy any existing config as a starting point:
   ```bash
   cp configs/webdev.yaml configs/my-custom.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the configuration to match your needs:
   ```bash
   nano configs/my-custom.yaml
   ```

3. Use your custom configuration:
   ```bash
   ./setup-env.sh install --config configs/my-custom.yaml
   ```

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Configuration Name"
  description: "Brief description"
  version: "1.0.0"

# Reference the main config for base settings

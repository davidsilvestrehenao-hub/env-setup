git-extras: this plugin provides completion definitions for some of the commands defined by git-extras, which must already be installed.


gitfast: this plugin adds completion for Git, using the zsh completion from git.git folks, which is much faster than the official one from zsh. A lot of zsh-specific features are not supported, like descriptions for every argument, but everything the bash completion has, this one does too (as it is using it behind the scenes). Not only is it faster, it should be more robust, and updated regularly to the latest git upstream version.

git-prompt: A zsh prompt that displays information about the current git repository. In particular: the branch name, difference with remote branch, number of files staged or changed, etc.

helm: this plugin adds completion for Helm, the Kubernetes package manager.

history: provides a couple of convenient aliases for using the history command to examine your command line history.

history-substring-search: this is a clean-room implementation of the [Fish shell][1]'s history search feature, where you can type in any part of any command from history and then press chosen keys, such as the UP and DOWN arrows, to cycle through matches.

kubectl: this plugin adds completion for kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool.

npm: the npm plugin provides completion as well as adding many useful aliases.

nvm: this plugin adds autocompletions for nvm â€” a Node.js version manager. It also automatically sources nvm, so you don't need to do it manually in your .zshrc.
